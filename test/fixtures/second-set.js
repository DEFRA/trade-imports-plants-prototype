/**
 * A further obligation set, defined only for tests.
 *
 * This repo is the prototype host, so it really does ship two sets —
 * high-risk-plants and sample-journey — and the root lists them rather than
 * redirecting to one. This fixture is mounted on top of those, as a THIRD set,
 * to keep the platform assertions readable: it is the smallest thing that
 * satisfies every configure* seam and mounts under its own prefix.
 *
 * It mirrors [`routes-high-risk-plants.js`](../../src/server/app/routes-high-risk-plants.js).
 *
 * Its routes deliberately echo the configuration they resolve rather than
 * render anything. A test asserting "this route saw its own set's obligations"
 * needs to read them back, and a template would only get in the way.
