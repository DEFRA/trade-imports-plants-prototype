/**
 * A second obligation set, defined only for tests.
 *
 * Co-residency is a property of the platform, not of any particular set, so
 * proving it needs two sets mounted in one process — but shipping a second
 * real set would mean shipping a journey nobody asked for. This fixture is the
 * smallest thing that satisfies every configure* seam and mounts under its own
 * prefix, so the co-residency and tripwire suites can register it alongside
 * high-risk-plants.
 *
 * Its routes deliberately echo the configuration they resolve rather than
 * render anything. A test asserting "this route saw its own set's obligations"
 * needs to read them back, and a template would only get in the way.
