/*
 * Status announcer — makes a server-rendered message actually announce.
 *
 * A live region that already holds its text when the document is parsed is
 * read as ordinary page content, not as a status. When an action performs a
 * full form submit, the status message arrives with a
 * fresh document every time. The region therefore ships empty and this writes
 * the message into it just after load, which is the mutation assistive
 * technology announces.
