/**
 * Boot-time completeness: a set that forgets a seam must not mount.
 *
 * Each seam still has its UNCONFIGURED fallback, untouched — this suite proves
 * the fallbacks can no longer be reached from a mounted set, because the mount
 * itself fails first. The three that matter most answer benignly rather than
 * throwing (`flow/journey-flow.js` returns no sections and no task rows,
 * `engine/persistence/session.js` returns the shared default cookie names, and
 * `bridge/readiness-config.js` answers false forever), so before this gate a
 * forgotten seam showed up as an empty dashboard or a jammed submit gate.
 *
 * The probes below are minimal gateways built here rather than in
 * `test/fixtures/second-set.js`: that fixture is a correctly wired set by
 * design, and these need to be wrong in one specific way each.
