/**
 * The collection cardinality link: a collection whose name is declared
 * in `MAX_ENTRIES_FROM` has its entry count capped at the value of the named
 * sibling count field in the frame that holds it. `appendEntryAt` rejects an
 * append at the cap.
 *
 * Returns the cap for the collection instance at `collectionPath`, or `null`
 * when uncapped: no cap declared, the count is unanswered, or the stored value
 * is not a non-negative integer. An unanswered count is deliberately NO cap —
 * the collection's at-least-one floor still applies at submit, so leaving the
 * count blank never lets a journey finish early.
 *
 * @param {object} answers - the nested answer POJO.
 * @param {Array} collectionPath - a collection path.
 * @returns {number|null} the cap, or null when uncapped.
