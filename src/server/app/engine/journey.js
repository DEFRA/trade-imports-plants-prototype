/**
 * Registers the journey cookies a set reads in STUB mode, scoped to that set's
 * own mount: stub mode keeps each value in a native cookie of its own, so a
 * draft started in one set is invisible to another set's dashboard. Moving
 * these off `/` invalidates existing browser sessions, which is the intended
 * one-off cost of splitting the namespace.
 *
 * The `path` scoping applies to those per-name cookies only. In REAL mode the
 * same values are keys inside the single @hapi/yar session cookie, which is
 * registered server-wide at path `/`; isolation there comes from each set's
 * cookie NAMES being distinct, not from the path. See
 * services/persistence/session/real.js.
 *
 * Both the path and the names come from the active set — the mount it
 * registered and the session seam it configured — rather than from arguments,
 * so what is registered cannot drift from what the set actually uses. Call it
 * inside the set's context, after `registerSetMount` and `configureSession`.
