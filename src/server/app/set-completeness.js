 * set mounted those fallbacks were unreachable. With several mounted they are
 * one forgotten call away, and three of them answer benignly rather than
 * throwing: the journey flow hands back no sections and no task rows, the
 * session hands back the shared default cookie names, and the
 * ready-for-check-your-answers roll-up answers false forever. A set that
 * forgets one therefore renders an empty dashboard — or a permanently jammed
 * submit gate — to a real user instead of failing.
 *
 * Refusing at registration turns that into a boot failure. The fallbacks
 * themselves are left exactly as they are — they simply stop being reachable.
