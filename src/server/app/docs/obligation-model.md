# Obligation model

The L2 model evaluates any configured obligation set. It contains no display copy,
route knowledge or journey imports.

## Registration

[`src/server/app/model/obligations/manifest.js`](../model/obligations/manifest.js)
holds the configured set behind accessors for `obligations`, `groups` and
`obligationByName`. L1 calls `configureObligationSet()` before any evaluator or
bridge operation.

A set owns the concrete declaration objects and manifest order. See the
[high-risk-plants obligation-set guide](../sets/high-risk-plants/docs/obligation-model.md).

## Obligation shape

An obligation has a stable UUID `id`, a path-safe `name` and either a direct
`status` or an `applyTo` rule that returns scope and mandate. Collection members use
`within` to point to their parent group. `requires` carries cardinality or
cross-field invariants.

Names cannot contain path metacharacters because the same vocabulary is used by
fulfilment paths and page dispatch.

## Scope helpers

The helper surface is exported from
[`src/server/app/model/obligations/helpers/index.js`](../model/obligations/helpers/index.js).
Helpers create `applyTo` functions and attach dependency metadata. The metadata
makes the dependency graph inspectable without parsing a closure.

Use the narrowest helper that expresses the rule. `branchedGate` is the escape hatch
for a rule that cannot use the standard equality, presence, inclusion or allow-list
helpers.

## Evaluation

[`src/server/app/model/obligations/evaluator.js`](../model/obligations/evaluator.js)
builds an index for the configured manifest, evaluates applicability, converges
scope and purges fulfilments that are unknown or out of scope. Evaluation is pure:
answers and fulfilments go in; derived views and cleaned fulfilment come out.

[`src/server/app/model/obligations/state-queries.js`](../model/obligations/state-queries.js)
provides read-only queries over evaluated state.

## Display and validation boundaries

Obligations describe domain applicability and completeness. They do not contain
titles, labels, hints, options, routes or templates. Controllers own input
validation and journeys own display copy.

[`src/server/app/model/no-display-keys.js`](../model/no-display-keys.js) and
[`src/server/app/obligation-purity.js`](../obligation-purity.js) enforce the
copy-free model rule.
