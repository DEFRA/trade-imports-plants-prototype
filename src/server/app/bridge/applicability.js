 * State-free commodity applicability — "does obligation X apply to

 * Answers the question a page must ask BEFORE any record exists (which
 * identifier fields to render for a picked commodity, which CYA rows a
 * line's commodity earns), so runtime scope (`makeScope`) cannot answer
 * it. Sourced from the manifest's gate metadata: the commodity-gated
 * helpers expose their allowlist on `applyTo.metadata.values` in the
 * stored picker-name vocabulary, so the stored commodity compares
 * directly.
 *
 * `notInUnionOf` gates are complements: they apply exactly when the
 * commodity is NOT in the derived union. Every other shape applies when
 * the commodity is in the list; an obligation with no commodity gate never
 * applies here, so a commodity on none of the identifier allowlists is
 * asked for no identifier at all.
