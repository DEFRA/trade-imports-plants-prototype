/**
 * Project the evaluator purge into the pathKeys it destroys — the write-path
 * counterpart of `scope.js`. Where `makeScope` projects the in-scope
 * implications into the pathKey grammar, `wipeSet` projects the PURGE into the
 * same grammar: the answer paths whose stored value `convergePurge` drops when
 * the obligation (or its instance) is out of scope.
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   request input fulfilments                                   = fIn
 *   request evaluation.fulfilments (converged post-purge view)  = fOut
 *   for each non-group leaf obligation answered in fIn but absent from fOut,
 *   emit its pathKey via the composite->positional rule.
 *
 * The result feeds `lib/path.js`'s `destroyWiped`, which `engine/write/index.js`
 * applies over the session/journey/save layer.
