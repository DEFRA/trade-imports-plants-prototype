/**
 * Project the obligation evaluator's implications into the `scope` object the
 * controllers and hub consume — `makeScopeFromEvaluation(evaluation,
 * answers)`, four members.
 *
 * The load-bearing member is `inScope: Set<pathKey>` — one key for every
 * in-scope node, a mix of:
 *   - bare top-level ids            `'scalarField'`
 *   - the group obligation node     `'itemCollection'`,
 *                                   `'itemCollection[0].nestedCollection'`
 *   - positional leaf paths         `'itemCollection[0].itemSelector'`,
 *                                   `'itemCollection[0].nestedCollection[1].nestedGatedField'`
 * The group OBLIGATION node is keyed once per parent instance, never a bare
 * group instance (`'itemCollection[0]'` is not a key).
 *
 * The set is built from the request-level evaluator output by projecting each
 * in-scope implication into the pathKey grammar (composite->positional
 * conversion).
