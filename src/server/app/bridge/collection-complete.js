/**
 * Per-instance completeness -> collectionView's `complete`.
 *
 * collectionView reads positional storage for a collection's entries; this
 * module supplies the per-entry `complete` flag. entries / index / path stay
 * positional, so an empty or partial entry is never lost; only its completeness
 * comes from the evaluator.
 *
 * Instance identity is positional (the array index). `fulfilmentIndexInstance`
 * maps a positional entry to its fulfilment index with the segment machinery,
 * exactly as scope.js / purge.js convert fulfilment index <-> positional. The
 * per-instance verdict itself is owned by the obligations model — see
 * `model/obligations/instance-complete.js` for the completeness rules.
 *
 * Known structural divergence retained: a fully-EMPTY nested instance (a unit
 * with no stored leaf) vanishes on round-trip and its unmet `anyOf` cannot be
 * flagged. A fully-empty TOP-LEVEL entry is caught via its unconditional
 * mandatory field leaves.
